						Anura Guruge, publisher of NhLifeFree.com had this to say about the performance</p>
						<blockquote>
							"Good classic Indian dancing, such as this, is indeed a treat to all senses; sinuous, sensual, precise, expressive, colorful and compelling.
							Lets face it. The dances have been perfected over a few thousand years!" and
							"It was an honor to see them perform at Laconia yesterday. They make me so proud and I am not even Indian (and never have been)! <br />
							I feel proud for the parents and for Neha Parikh."
