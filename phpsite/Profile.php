She was exposed to the beautiful and intense art form of Bharata Natyam from a tender age of 7.

Thangamani Nagarajan, Smt.Malati Agniswaran, Shri Vaibhav Areker and Smt.Ambika Vishwanathan who were the lecturers at Nalanda Institute.<br /><br />
                She also had the honor of performing major roles in the most prestigious productions of Nalanda like  'Shilappadikaram', 'Santavani', 'Kanchanmrig', and 'Swapnavasadattam' at various prominent venues in India.
